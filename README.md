# Prime
This repository will contain Rods test.

To run this project download the files and open primeTest in your favourite IDE
for example: 

I use netBeans, to run this project I would:
  1. Click file 
  2. Select open Project
  3. Navigate to the location of primeTest
  4. Select primeTest
  5. and open primeTest.java from inside the IDE
  6. then click run, or right click and select run file

Once that is done you will be asked to enter the number of primes, 
enter it in the console. Once that is done the program should start running.
  
Note: I have litte experience in formatting tables. The formating code could be 
refactored using a java table formatting library which would make the code simpler
and easier to read.

What I am pleased with:

I think i've written a pretty good prime algorithm,because it skips
the unecessary calculations by discarding even numbers it becomes O(n log n) rather than O(n^2). 

What I would do if I had more time:

Most likely look at the formatting again, while it does what it's supposed to do
I think I could write it better given more time.
